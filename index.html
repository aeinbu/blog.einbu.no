                <h2>Custom ASP.NET DataSource parameters</h2>
                <small>February 2010</small>
                <p>
                    With ASP.NETs DataSource controls you can parameterize your query and have those parameters
                    automatically fetched from one of a few standard sources. Those include getting a parameter value
                    from the querystring, a form parameter, a control or from a users session variables, profile or
                    cookies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These parameter types enables us to build a lot of functionality without leaving ASP.NET markup.
                    Still, they don't cover every imaginable scenario. So when someone asked how
                    to get the username as a parameter in this question on Stackoverflow, it inspired me to
                    write this article.

                <h2>Diving deeper into Windows Azure table storage</h2>
                <small>September 2009</small>
                <p>
                    In a previous post about Windows Azure Table Storage</a>, I relied on the StorageClient project in
                    the Azure SDK samples. This feels a bit strange, and raises the question: Am I expected to include
                    references to sample projects and be using Microsoft.Samples.whatever namespaces in my future
                    projects?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This raises a couple of questions about license, copyright, support and more. Instead of digging
                    into those questions, I came up with some alternate questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What does this sample project give us?</li>
                    <li>How does it work?</li>
                    <li>Can we do these things ourselves?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A lot of the searching was done in the sample code, since most of the other articles about accessing
                    Windows Azure Table Storage depend on the same sample files. I was disappointed to see that even the
                    Windows Azure SDK help file shows some partial code calling into the sample project. Little help
                    there…

                <p>
                    Ok, I know this isn't exactly breaking news. Twitter has been out there for a couple of years, but
                    still many people don't know what Twitter is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're one of them, have a look at this short video explaining Twitter. <em>(Link in the
                        article)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And even knowing what Twitter is, fewer understand the fascination with it.
                    I think Twitter with its simplicity has several interresting aspects, and they are different for all
                    of us.

                <h2>Authenticating against Azure Table Storage</h2>
                <small>August 2009</small>
                <p>
                    When searching for articles/blogs/samples about using Azure Table Storage from .NET, it seems most
                    of them (if not all) depend on the StorageClient sample in the Azure SDK. I read about
                    authentication with SharedKey or SharedKeyLite, and I always found the magic of these authentication
                    schemes were wrapped up into several layers of abstractions in this SDK sample.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hoping that I could get at my data without it (the sample), I needed to research how to authenticate
                    against Azure Table Storage. So how does it all work?

                <h2>How to use Windows Azure table storage</h2>
                <small>August 2009</small>
                <p>
                    I found several great articles showing how to work with Windows Azure Table Storage:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rob Bagby's Azure Application Part 2: Access Azure Table Storage</li>
                    <li>Jim Nakashima's Windows AzureWalkthrough: Table Storage</li>
                    <li>Video tutorials on Microsofts Azure developer portal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All these, however, assume that the table storage will be used from an Azure web or worker role. I
                    wanted to see if the Windows Azure Table Store could be used with applications running elsewhere,
                    like on your computer. I'm creating a console application here, but the code can be easily adapted
                    to a WPF, Windows Forms or even an ASP.NET application too.

                <p>
                    While I believe most or many developers have heard of JUnit/NUnit/&lt;your testing framework
                    here&gt;, fewer know how to write a test and running it using such a framework. And from those, even
                    fewer have a good understanding of how to make unit testing a part of the development workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've known about unit testing and unit test frameworks for maybe 7-8 years. I first tried using it
                    in a small project 5-6 years ago, but it is only in the last few years that I've learned how to do
                    it right. (ie. found a way that works for me and my team…)
                </p>

                <small>June 2009</small>
                <p>
                    In this previous article articles about parsing files, I took a very simplistic approach to reading
                    a delimited file. I used string.Split, which doesn't handle the use of quotes and usage of the
                    delimiter character inside quotes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it turns out theres more to reading a delimited file than splitting at the delimiter…

                <p>
                    In a previous article, I described how to use LINQ when parsing a textfile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that train of thoughts further, I found a more elegant way of splitting the lines from the
                    file into columns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating extension methods on top of IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; seems like a good idea! Something
                    that could be used like this for a comma-separated file:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
from columns in reader.AsEnumerable().AsDelimited(delimiter)

                    Reading and parsing files is really no difficult task with the .NET framework. The System.IO
