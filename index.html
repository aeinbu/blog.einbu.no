                    ASP.NET WebForms' DataSource controls lets you parameterize your query and have those parameters
                    automatically fetched from one of a few standard sources. Like from the querystring, a form
                    parameter, a cookie etc.

                <p>
                    This article shows you how to create your own custom parameters from other sources.

                    Ok, I know this isn't exactly breaking news. Twitter has been out there for a couple of years, but
                    still many people don't know what Twitter is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think Twitter with its simplicity has several interresting aspects, and they are different for all
                    of us.

                    Most articles and samples on using Azure table storage assume that it will be used from an Azure web or worker role.

                    I expected that would be easy with LINQ, but quickly realized that there is no method in the .NET

                    I found a question titled: Why is code quality not popular? on Stackoverflow yesterday. Several

                    There were a lot of misconceptions there. Here are the main reasons mentioned against unit testing
                    (the myths) with my responses.

                <p>
                    In a previous article articles about parsing files, I took a very simplistic approach to reading
                    a delimited file. I used string.Split, which doesn't handle the use of quotes and usage of the
                    delimiter character inside quotes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it turns out theres more to reading a delimited file than splitting at the delimiter...

                <p>
                    In a previous article, I described how to use LINQ when parsing a textfile.

                <p>
                    Following that train of thoughts further, I found a more elegant way of splitting the lines from the

                    Reading and parsing files is really no difficult task with the .NET framework. This article shows
                    how you can use LINQ to read files.
