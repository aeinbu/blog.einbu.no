                    What is the fascination with Twitter?
                </h2>
                <small>August 2009</small>
                <p>
                    Ok, I know this isn't exactly breaking news. Twitter has been out there for a couple of years, but still many people don't know what Twitter is.
                </p>
				<p>
                    If you're one of them, have a look at this short video explaining Twitter. <em>(Link in the article)</em>
                </p>
				<p>
                    And even knowing what Twitter is, fewer understand the fascination with it.
                    I think Twitter with its simplicity has several interresting aspects, and they are different for all of us.

                <p>
                    RecentIy I needed to find a specific TreeNode in a TreeView control.
                </p>
				<p>
                    I expected that would be easy with LINQ, but quickly realized that there is no method in the .NET framework that will let me traverse all nodes of a hierarchy.

				<p>
                    I decided to create one myself.

                <h2>Mythbusters: Unit-testing</h2>
                <small>July 2009</small>
                <p>
                    While I believe most or many developers have heard of JUnit/NUnit/&lt;your testing framework here&gt;, fewer know how to write a test and running it using such a framework. And from those, even fewer have a good understanding of how to make unit testing a part of the development workflow.
                </p>
				<p>
                    I've known about unit testing and unit test frameworks for maybe 7-8 years. I first tried using it in a small project 5-6 years ago, but it is only in the last few years that I've learned how to do it right. (ie. found a way that works for me and my team…)
                </p>
				<p> 
                    For me some of the things learned were:

				<h2>The trouble with delimited</h2>
                <small>June 2009</small>
				<p>
                    In this previous article articles about parsing files, I took a very simplistic approach to reading a delimited file. I used string.Split, which doesn't handle the use of quotes and usage of the delimiter character inside quotes.
                </p>
				<p>
                    Well, it turns out theres more to reading a delimited file than splitting at the delimiter…

				<h2>
                    More parsing textfiles with LINQ
                </h2>
                <small>March 2009</small>
				<p>
                    In a previous article, I described how to use LINQ when parsing a textfile.
                </p>
				<p>
                    Following that train of thoughts further, I found a more elegant way of splitting the lines from the file into columns.
                </p>
				<p>
                    Creating extension methods on top of IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; seems like a good idea! Something that could be used like this for a comma-separated file:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
from columns in reader.AsEnumerable().AsDelimited(delimiter)
select ...
</pre>

                    Parsing textfiles with LINQ (or LINQ-to-TextReader)

				<p>
                    Reading and parsing files is really no difficult task with the .NET framework. The System.IO namespace has several good classes to aid that task.
