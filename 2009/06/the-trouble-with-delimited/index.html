                <h2>The trouble with delimited</h2>
                <small>Originally published on blog.einbu.no June 27. 2009</small>
                <p>
                    In this <a href="/2009/03/parsing-textfiles-with-linq/">previous article about parsing files</a>, I took a very simplistic approach to reading a delimited file. I used string.Split, which doesn't handle the use of quotes and usage of the delimiter character inside quotes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, <em>it turns out theres more to reading a delimited file than splitting at the delimiter...</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this a problem? It depends on wether or not the file you're parsing contains quotes and you are expected to handle them correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's a sample file that demonstrates the problem:
                </p>
                <pre class="csv">
id;productname;price
1;apple;1.0
2;something with a space in it;1.4
3;"something in quotes";2.0
4;"quotes and a ;";2.4
5;"quotes containing single quotes like 'this'";3.0
</pre>
                <p>
                    The string.Split approach will give us the double-quote-characters as part of our fields for each line from no. 3, and will give us 4 fields for no. 5 and 6. (All lines here have exactly 3 fields.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do we handle that correctly?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could write out own split method. Perhaps using regular expressions? Do I know all the rules I want to adhere to?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe it would be best if we can pick a piece of code thats already well tested to do that job for us. Well, as it turns out, Microsoft actually delivers a decent parser as part of the .net framework. Its in the Microsoft.VisualBasic assembly
                (well hidden from us C# developers). Its the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualbasic.fileio.textfieldparser.aspx">TextFieldParser class</a> in the Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO namespace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the code samples for this class in MSDN are all in VB, but that doesn't mean that we can't use it from C#. I've written a replacement for my previous GetSplittedLines extension method.
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
public static class LinqToTextReader
{
    public static IEnumerable<string[]> GetSplittedLines(this TextReader reader, string[] delimiters)
    {
        using (var parser = new TextFieldParser(reader))
        {
            parser.Delimiters = delimiters;
            string[] fields;
            while ((fields = parser.ReadFields()) != null)
            {
                yield return fields;
            }
        }
    }

    public static IEnumerable<string[]> GetSplittedLines(this TextReader reader, string delimiter)
    {
        return GetSplittedLines(reader, new[] { delimiter });
    }
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    Now we can use it to correctly handle all the lines in my sample text file like this:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
using (var reader = new StreamReader(@"testdata.txt"))
{
    var query = from line in reader.GetSplittedLines(';').Skip(1) //skip header row
                select new {
                    Firstname = columns[0],
                    Lastname = columns[1],
                    Age = columns[2]
                }

    //...do something with the results of query...
}
</pre>
