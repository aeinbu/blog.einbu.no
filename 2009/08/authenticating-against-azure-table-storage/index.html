				<h2>Authenticating against Azure Table Storage</h2>
				<small>Originally published on blog.einbu.no August 25. 2009</small>
				<p>
					When searching for articles/blogs/samples about using Azure Table Storage from .NET, it seems most
					of them (if not all) depend on the StorageClient sample in the Azure SDK. I read about
					authentication with SharedKey or SharedKeyLite, and I always found the magic of these authentication
					schemes were wrapped up into several layers of abstractions in this SDK sample.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hoping that I could get at my data without it (the sample), I needed to research how to authenticate
					against Azure Table Storage.
				</p>
				<h2>
					So how does it all work?
				</h2>
				<p>
					It all starts with the request...
				</p>
				<p>
					You can query a table by sending a http request to the Table Storage. Crafting the correct request
					involves setting the correct headers, and requesting the desired resource at the Azure storage
					services HTTP-endpoint.
				</p>
				<p>
					Azure Table Storage uses the same REST scheme as ADO.NET Data Services (Astoria), so with

					<pre class="code">
http://account_name.table.core.windows.net/name_of_table
</pre>
				<p>
					you'll get all the rows of a table. To filter the data, add the filter as the query string:
				</p>
					<pre class="code">
http://account_name.table.core.windows.net/name_of_table()?top=3
</pre>
				<p>
					Ideally you should be able to do this from your favourite web browsers address bar!
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm sorry, but you can't. You'll need to authenticate to the Azure Table Store, and this is done by
					adding special headers to the request.
				</p>
				<h2>
					What special headers?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Well, the authentication headers, of course. Microsoft have devised two variations over a simple
					authentication scheme that we can choose between. They are called SharedKey and SharedKeyLite, and
					they involve adding a date header and an authentication header to the request.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the more comprehensive articles I found on the topic, was <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179428.aspx">this MSDN article</a>. It tells what
					parts the signatures are made from, but again, the actual code sample is heavily dependent on the
					StorageClient sample project in the Azure SDK. (Did I say, this happens a lot?)
				</p>
				<p>
					Still most articles I come over when searching about using Azure Table Storage from C# use the
					StorageClient sample. It makes me wonder: Can I use Azure table storage without this sample? Or
					duplicating it?
				</p>
				<p>
					It turns out I can! <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rxg/archive/2009/04/02/accessing-azure-tables-via-rest.aspx">Here is the first blogpost I found which shows how</a>. And its really not that
					hard! Programatically in C# we should be able to do it quite easily when we know how to create and
					add those headers.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Creating the SharedKey or SharedKeyLite headers
				</h2>
				<p>
					The additional headers look the same for both of the authentiation schemes:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
x-ms-date: date_and_time
Authorization: scheme_name account_name:signature
</pre>
				<p>
					where we specify the <code>date_and_time</code>, <code>scheme_name</code>, <code>account_name</code> and signature parts. The date_and_time
					is copied from either the date or <code>x-ms-date</code> header. Then we choose whether we're going to use the
					SharedKey or SharedKeyLite authentication scheme (replace scheme_name with either one), before
					filling in the <code>account_name</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now only the signature remains! So, how do we create this signature? They're similar, but
					SharedKeyLite takes fewer variables in creating the signature than SharedKey does.
				</p>
				<p>
					To start with, we need to construct a string that contains some information about our request. Azure
					table storage must be able to re-create the same string on the server side, so all this information
					must also be available elsewhere in the request. Here is an actual sample of how it looks for
					SharedKey authentication:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
GET

application/xml
Mon, 24 Aug 2009 22:08:56 GMT
/myaccount/mytable
</pre>
<p>
In the blank lines after the method (GET), you'll copy the Content-MD5 header if it exists, or just leave a blank line if you don't have it. The content-type in the third line is also optional, but it MUST match the value of the Content-Type header. SharedKeyLite is simpler than this, as its built from only the last two lines; the current time, and the line containing the account name (myaccount) and resource name (mytable).
</p>
				<p>
					As you can see, the signature contains a time component to hinder record/playback attacks. Windows
					Azure only accepts this time within a range of 15 minutes, so make sure your computer's clock is
					right. The time component of the signature must also be added as a header so that Azure can verify
					the signature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Azure will accept this as either the <code>date</code> header or the <code>x-ms-date</code> header. I chose the latter
					one, so lets just add it:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
request.Headers.Add("x-ms-date", DateTime.Now.ToString("R"));
</pre>
				<p> From this we create this authorization header:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
Authorization: SharedKey myaccount:boiVITAm6Wf4NEoV0fTmu5YnAH6x/DG8CzWyaRu1UaI=
</pre>
				<p> In C# I'll construct the SharedKey signature with this string:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
string stringToSign = string.Format("{0}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n/{4}/{5}",
	request.Method,
	request.Headers["Content-MD5"],
	request.Headers["Content-Type"],
	request.Headers["x-ms-date"],
	account,
	resource);
</pre>
				<p> ...or the SharedKeyLite signature with this one:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
string stringToSign = string.Format("{0}\n/{1}/{2}",
	request.Headers["x-ms-date"],
	account,
	resource);
</pre>
				<p>
					This string is then signed with the SHA256 algorithm using a shared key, and added in the
					authorization header. We can find the shared key typed out in base64 encoding in the Azure
					Admininstration web pages when we log in.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can now create the authorization header like this:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
var sharedKey = Convert.FromBase64("the_sharedkey_from_the_azure_web");

var hasher = new HMACSHA256(sharedKey);

string signature = hasher.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(strignToSign))
string authorizationHeader = string.Format("SharedKey {0}:{1}",
	_account,
	Convert.ToBase64String(signature));
</pre>
				<p> And add it like this:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", authorizationHeader);
</pre>
				<h2>
					Putting it all together
				</h2>
				<p>
					A complete WebRequest from C# to get data from Azure Table Storage with SharedKeyLite can be made
					like this:
				</p>
				<pre class="code">
var account = "myaccount";
var sharedKey = Convert.FromBase64String("Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==");

var request = WebRequest.Create("http://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/mytable");
request.ContentLength = 0;
request.Headers.Add("x-ms-date", DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("R", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));

var resource = request.RequestUri.PathAndQuery;
if (resource.Contains("?"))
{
	resource = resource.Substring(0, resource.IndexOf("?"));
}

string stringToSign = string.Format("{0}\n/{1}{2}",
		request.Headers["x-ms-date"],
		account,
		resource
	);

var hasher = new HMACSHA256(sharedKey);

string signedSignature = Convert.ToBase64String(hasher.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(stringToSign)));
string authorizationHeader = string.Format("{0} {1}:{2}", "SharedKeyLite", account, signedSignature);
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", authorizationHeader);

var response = request.GetResponse();

using(var sr = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()))
{
	var doc = XElement.Load(sr);

	Console.WriteLine(doc);
}
</pre>
				<p> Note: Remember to insert your own account and sharedKey in this code.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Which to use?
				</h2>
				<p>
					I've explained both the Sharedkey and SharedkeyLite authentication schemes for use with Azure Table
					Storage. Which one should I use?
				</p>
				<p>
					Since SharedKey is more robust than SharedKeyLite, that would be the obvious choice. However, we
					still need the SharedKeyLite scheme to access the Development Table Storage, since it is the only
					one that it accepts. (As of the July CTP of the Windows Azure SDK.)
