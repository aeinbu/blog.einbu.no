                    Parsing textfiles with LINQ (or LINQ-to-TextReader)
                </h2>
                <small>Originally published on blog.einbu.no March 27. 2009</small>
                <p>
                    Reading and parsing files is really no difficult task with the .NET framework. The System.IO
                    namespace has several good classes to aid that task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can use streams and readers to get the data from the file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When using a the StreamReader we state our intent in a imperative way. We create loops to iterate
                    over all the lines, maybe after skipping a header row, complete with logic to tell when we reached
                    the end of the file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LINQ shows us alternate ways to write code, introducing a more declarative coding paradigm. To use
                    LINQ over the lines of a file, we can read all the lines in the file into a collection, and use LINQ
                    over that collection. There's some overhead to this; the need to read the entire file upfront and to
                    fit the entire file in memory at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can we combine the best of both worlds? Can we use LINQ over a file? No, there are no types dealing
                    with files or streams in the .NET framework that support LINQ yet. But let's give it a try anyway:
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Let's LINQ-enable the TextReader class.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We can use LINQ over any collection or type that implements IEnumerable, so I've written the
                    AsEnumerable() extension method to the TextReader class:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
public static class LinqToTextReader
{
    public static IEnumerable AsEnumerable(this TextReader reader)
    {
        string line;
        while ((line=reader.ReadLine()) != null)
        {
            yield return line;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    This will let us use LINQ statements like:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
using (var reader = new StreamReader(@"testdata.txt"))
{
    var query = from line in reader.AsEnumerable().Skip(1) //skip header row
                let columns = line.Split('\t')
                select new {
                    Firstname = columns[0],
                    Lastname = columns[1],
                    Age = columns[2]
                };

    //...do something with the results of query...
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    This is already simpler than looping over the reader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the times I'll need to split the line into pieces as in the above example, so I created
                    another extension method in the LinqToTextReader class that would return columns in a delimited
                    textfile:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
public static IEnumerable GetSplittedLines(this TextReader reader, params char[] separators)
{
    foreach (var line in reader.AsEnumerable())
    {
        yield return line.Split(separators);
    }
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    <s>
                        (I just picked one of the overloads for string.Split, and a full-fledged LinqToTextReader class
                        could implement the other six overloads as well.)
                    </s>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        UPDATE: You'll find a better and more robust solution in the <a
                            href="/2009/06/the-trouble-with-delimited/">"The Trouble With Delimited"</a> post.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the same query as above can be written like this:
                </p>
                <pre class="code">
using (var reader = new StreamReader(@"testdata.txt"))
{
    var query = from line in reader.GetSplittedLines('\t').Skip(1) //skip header row
                select new {
                    Firstname = columns[0],
                    Lastname = columns[1],
                    Age = columns[2]
                }

    //...do something with the results of query...
}
